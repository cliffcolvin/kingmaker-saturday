# 🏰 Kingmaker 2e — Player’s Guide to Revised Kingdom Rules

Welcome to your kingdom! These revised rules are designed to make kingdom building faster, fairer, and more fun — while still honoring the spirit of Paizo’s Kingmaker Adventure Path.

---

## 🎯 Why These Rules?
These changes improve the **math, flexibility, and pacing** of the kingdom building system. Your kingdom grows alongside you, with clearer rewards and more engaging choices — without dead turns or math traps.

---

## 🛠️ Kingdom Creation Changes
- Charters **and** Heartlands now grant a trained skill.
- If you get a duplicate skill, choose a different one.
- Starting ability boosts increased from **2 → 3**.

---

## 📈 Kingdom Advancement Changes
- Gain a **skill increase every level**, starting at level 2.
- Boost **three** ability scores at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20 (instead of two).
- At level 2, gain **Untrained Improvisation**: add half your level to untrained checks.
- At level 7, that bonus increases to your **full level** (still untrained).

## 🧭 New & Updated Activities

### 🌿 Reconnoiter Hex *(Wilderness)*
Spend 1 RP to scout a hex without needing the party to explore it.
- Success: the hex is ready for claiming.
- Critical: you also discover a feature or avoid a hazard.

### 💼 Take Charge *(General)*
Always usable. Roll a skill check:
- Success: Gain 1 RP.
- Critical: Also gain +1 on the next check using that skill.

### 🧱 Other Fixes
- **Capital Investment** can now be used from your Capital early on.
- **Request Foreign Aid** limited to 1x per group per Kingdom Turn, and the DC now escalates with repeated use.

## 🪙 XP & Kingdom Growth

Your kingdom now levels at a better pace with:
- 📍 **Expanded Milestones** (e.g. first farm, first trade agreement, first quarry).
- 🧱 **Hex claiming XP** now scales by size. Small kingdoms grow faster.
- 🔄 **Leftover RP → XP** conversion is stronger at low levels.

---

## 🏛️ Structures & Item Bonuses

Many new or revised buildings now grant bonuses:
- 🧺 **Granary**: +1 to Establish Farmland
- 📚 **Library**: +1 to Creative Solution
- ⚒️ **Smithy**: +1 to Clear Hex
- 🍻 **Taverns**: +1 to +3 to Reconnoiter Hex, depending on tier

GM tip: Structures now stack item bonuses across different types (e.g., Library + Monument) for the same activity.

---

## ✨ Kingdom Feats Clarified

- Feat bonuses (status) now **stack properly** with leadership role bonuses.
- 🧙‍♂️ **Practical Magic** no longer replaces Engineering — it gives a bonus instead.
- Feats now actually do something and are worth picking again!

---

## 👑 Final Notes

Your kingdom is now a full-fledged PC: it learns, adapts, and grows as you do. You’ll face new problems, build amazing cities, and rule your realm like legends.

> Rule well, adventurers — the realm remembers its founders.
